Find a tutorial on this on my [portfolio site](http://www.wesduff.com/tutorial-nodemailer-sendgrid)

    $ git clone https://github.com/wesleyduff/nodemailer-sendgrid.git

    $ npm install

Start the server on port 3000

    $ node server

Basic light version of a basic Node Express Jade install with 
  -  nodemailer
  -  sendGrid

This is a good base to start off with an app that will use an email service.
